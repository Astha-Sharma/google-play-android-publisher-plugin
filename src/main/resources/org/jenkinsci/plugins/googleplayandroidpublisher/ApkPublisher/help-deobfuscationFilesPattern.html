<div>
  Specifies a filepath or -pattern matching one deobfuscation-file per APK that gets uploaded to Google Play,
  e.g. "<tt>../mapping/*/mapping.txt</tt>".
  <p/>
  The path to the deobfuscation-file is resolved relative to the directory of each APK.<br/>
  Missing deobfuscation-files or multiple matches are ignored.
  <p/>
  At the beginning of the path you can use "<tt>../</tt>" (also more than once) to search relative to an
  ancestor-directory. However, you cannot leave the workspace.<br/>
  You can also use wildcards like "<tt>**/mapping/*/*-mapping.txt</tt>". See
  <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a>
  for the exact format.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
